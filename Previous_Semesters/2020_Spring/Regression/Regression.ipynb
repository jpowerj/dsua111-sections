    "Before starting grad school I worked as a development economist, where nearly every \"bad\" aspect of a nation's political economy (low GDP growth, high infant mortality rate, etc.) is attributed to something \"internal\" to the nation in its present form (not enough free markets!), rather than the historical context of how the country got to where it is now. The problem with ignoring this aspect of a country's political economy is that it conveniently sweeps under the rug the decades (and often centuries) during which the nation's economy was *not* under its own control, but rather under the control of its colonizer. Thus I am interested in quantitatively studying the impacts of colonialism on present-day socioeconomic conditions of a country."

Actually, first I found this one: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UQZFYA but it (bafflingly) commits the *cardinal sin* we learned in this course, namely, selecting on the dependent variable -- it *only* includes colonized countries, and omits non-colonized countries (for example, the countries *doing* the colonization).\n",

    "Now, this scatterplot helps me see that a few countries have extremely large `yrs_since_ind` values, which hinders our ability to see the relationship displayed in the scatterplot because most of the points are bunched up on the left side of the plot. So, I *could* just choose some arbitrary threshold -- say, 600 years -- and remove all outlier countries with `yrs_since_ind` values greater than this. But (tying history/social science knowledge in with our data analysis, always a good thing to do if you can), there's actually a fairly solid rationale for choosing **368 years** as this threshold: namely, that in 1648 the [Treaty of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) was signed, thus inaugurating (in the eyes of many/most scholars of International Relations, at least) the modern notion of [territorial sovereignty](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/territorial-sovereignty-9780198833536?cc=us&lang=en&) in which we associate the abstract entity of a \"state\" or \"nation\" with a physical geographic territory over which the government of that \"state\"/\"nation\" has sovereign power.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with that in mind, I create a new DataFrame called `merged_df_tw` (`tw` standing for Treaty of Westphalia), containing only those countries that gained independence since 1648, and generate the same scatterplot using this new data so that we can more clearly see the relationship between our two variables of interest:"

We would expect that a disproportionate number of these low-life-expectancy countries are recently-liberated colonies, based on our (alternative) hypothesis, but this plot can't show us *which* countries are in that whisker. So, it was a useful graph for getting a sense of the distribution of life expectancies in the dataset, but it would be more helpful if it allowed us to (say) mouse over the whisker and see which countries have life expectancies in that range."

In the language of bootstrap sampling we've been using in lecture/section, this roughly corresponds to generating 1 million simulated datasets (under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, so that the life expectancy and years since independence for each country would be generated totally randomly and independently of one another), and only seeing 11 with a test statistic this extreme."

In this case, for the `yrs_since_ind` row that we care about, the 95% confidence interval is `[0.022, 0.056]`, which means that if we repeatedly sampled life expectancy and years-since-independence data over and over again, we'd expect that 95% of the time the mean of these samples would lie between 0.022 and 0.056 (it's a bit contrived here, since we actually have almost the full population of all countries, but technically in frequentist statistics you're supposed to imagine \"superpopulations\" like alternate counterfactual universes that a particular \"realized\" population is sampled from...)"

    "Finally, we get an $R^2$ value, listed in the righthand column of the regression results (directly underneath `OLS Regression Results`), of 0.011. There's actually a good amount of controversy in the statistics world about how to interpret an $R^2$ value, but often it's summarized as something like \"x% of the variation in my dependent variable is 'explained by' my independent variable(s).\" So, in this case, we can say something like \"1.1% of the variation in life expectancy is 'explained by' the number of years since independence.\" Although this seems quite low, variables at this \"macroscopic\" level will often result in fairly low $R^2$ values, because so many millions of different factors go into and cause variation in these outcomes. One rule of thumb I learned as an economics student in undergrad went like: scientists who can control (almost) everything about their experiment can interpret an $R^2$ value above 0.3 as indicating a \"strong\" relationship between independent and dependent variables, whereas for microeconomists who study individual people this threshold is more like 0.15, and for macroeconomists who study entire national economies this threshold can be around 0.05. But this is a SUPER rough heuristic, so please don't quote me on it!"

    "A **residual plot** is just a scatterplot (or, even better, a `regplot`) where the x-axis is the independent variable as before (in the plots above), *but* the y-axis is now the *distance* between the regression line and the actual data points in the dataset. So, for example, if the dataset had a country with 150 years since independence and a life expectancy of 80 years, but the y-value of the *regression line* at x=150 years was 70.2, the y value for this point on the *residual* plot would be 80-70.2 = 9.8. Note that the residual can also be *negative* if the regression line \"predicted\" a value that was too high: if the dataset had a country with 100 years since independence and a life expectancy of 60 years, but the y-value of the *regression line* at x=100 years was 75.5, the residual for this data point would be 60-75.5 = -15.5.\n",

    "As for that big word at the end of the first sentence of the question, \"heteroskedasticity\" is just the situation where the residuals, the errors in your regression line's \"prediction\" for each data point, are *correlated with* the independent variable. This is a bad thing, since the validity of the regression procedure *requires* the absence of heteroskedasticity (i.e., requires that the errors in the regression line's \"predictions\" be uncorrelated with the independent variable). Here, however, we see very little evidence for such a correlation, when we use `regplot` to plot the *residuals* (accessed via the `resid` property of the regression result object) against the independent variable (years since independence):"

    "One obvious bias in the sample itself is survivorship bias: since both datasets only contain countries that exist in 2016, we don't observe situations where a country gained independence but was then \"merged into\" another country. For example, [Zanzibar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar) gained independence in 1963, but merged with Tanganyika in 1964 to form Tanzania; [Biafra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra) seceded from Nigeria in 1967 but was re-absorbed into Nigeria in 1970. Similarly, we are unable to \"track\" differences in life expectancy between East and West Germany, despite the fact that they were independent nations for much of the 20th century (between 1949 and 1990)."

    "The $p$-value is low enough (indistinguishable from zero, given the number of decimal places that the `statsmodels` package displays) to be considered \"statistically significant\" in the classical statistics sense. Thus, going \"by the book\", we have resoundingly rejected the null hypothesis that the number of years of independence has no effect on the life expectancy of a country. However, a lot of subjective decisions were made -- specifically, when exactly to mark \"independence\" is extremely non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give just one example, did Serbia become \"independent\" when the Congress of Berlin recognized it as a sovereign nation in 1878? When it became part of the \"Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes\" in 1918? When it was liberated from Nazi Germany after WWII and became part of Yugoslavia in 1945? Or when it became an independent nation after the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1992? If we *do* mark the date of liberation from Nazi occupation as the date of independence, don't we also need to change France's date of independence from 943 A.D. to 1945?\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues like these make it imperative that we be *very* cautious when interpreting the results of super-basic linear regression analyses. Without controlling for confounders (e.g., the colonizing-country variable mentioned in Q3), and without doing a barrage of additional tests of *causality* (remember, linear regression is a test of *association*, not *causation*), it really is irresponsible to say something like \"I've now shown that being colonized for longer causes a country to have a lower life expectancy!\""
